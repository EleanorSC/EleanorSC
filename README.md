## My work
I'm a Junior Research Fellow in Applied AI at **Lady Margaret Hall** at the University of Oxford. I work across large-scale longitudinal cohort data (UK Biobank, Generation Scotland, Lothian Birth Cohorts, Stratifying Longitudinal Resilience and Depression Cohort, and Theirworld Edinburgh Birth Cohort) using [machine learning to identify epigenomic biomarkers of brain ageing](https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/our-people/dr-eleanor-conole)

Across projects, I aim to follow open, transparent, and reproducible research practices. Where possible, analyses are shared as documented, reusable code to support collaboration, review, and reuse.

Before working in AI, I did a Wellcome Trust PhD in **Translational Neuroscience** at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked in the [**Lothian Birth Cohorts group**]([(https://github.com/LothianBirthCohorts)]).
